# SoundBoardQuick

This is basically a test to see if I could learn QtQuick<->C++ integration and build something I needed in the process.
This repository contains about one hour of work. I'll probably won't work on this any more.

## Functionality

The application scans for sound files in the subdirectory *sounds* (on Android in */sdcard/Downloads/sounds* ) and enable a button for each sound.
The sounds then can be started/stopped by clicking a button.

## Todo:

* finish code to enable looping of sounds
* fix code to detect if a file format can be played
